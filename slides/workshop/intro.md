## Introduction

<img align="right" src="images/control-vs-data.png">
Performance in information systems is inseparable from such concerns as **cost** and **reliability** (r9y).

Therefore - when discussing how to tune our Kubernetes workloads for performance we'll also be looking at optimizing for cost and r9y.

Most of the workshop is dedicated to optimizing the performance and cost of the workloads that Kubernetes orchestrates (the data plane).

We will dedicate some time in the end to discussing optimizing the performance of the control plane too.
