## Kubernetes Performance Foundations

In this workshop we will be looking at optimizing the performance of applications running in a Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes or not - application performance is impacted by the following:
- Code efficiency
    -   Memory usage
    -   Stack depth
- Infrastructre Resource Availability:
    -   Compute (cpu time)
    -   Memory
    -   Network
    -   Storage (disk I/O)
